## Abstract

This tutorial presents the ontological approach to systems modeling and analysis using the [Ontological Modeling Language (OML)](http://www.opencaesar.io/oml/), developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), and contributed through the [openCAESAR](http://www.opencaesar.io/) project. The tutorial intends to give users some experience with OML and its tools involving developing a semantic vocabulary, using it to describe a system, and analyzing the system description for consistency using a logical reasoner, a set of queries, and a UI viewpoint. Familiarity with using the Eclipse IDE would greatly help. Some background in system modeling with languages like UML or SysML, and some knowledge about semantic web would also help but is not essential.

## 1 Install Rosetta Application

### 1.1 Option 1: Install Locally

1. Download the latest release of the Rosetta zip archive that matches your OS from [oml-rosetta](https://github.com/opencaesar/oml-rosetta/releases/latest).

1. Unzip the archive to a local folder to get the Rosetta app.
    
   * On Mac OS, subsequently run the following command in Terminal.

     ```
      $xttr -cr <path/to/Rosetta.app>
     ```

### 1.2 Option 2: Install from a Docker Image

TBD: Alternatively, download the Rosetta App Docker image from this link.

## 2 Launch Rosetta Application

1. Navigate to the Rosetta app icon and double click it to open.
