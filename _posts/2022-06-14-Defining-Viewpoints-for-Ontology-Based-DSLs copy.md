# Abstract


The [openCAESAR](http://www.opencaesar.io/) project provides an EMF-based implementation of the [Ontological Modeling Language (OML)](http://www.opencaesar.io/oml), which simplifies the use of semantic web ontologies for modeling and analysis. An OML model can be either be a vocabulary model that defines the terms and rules in a business domain with precise syntax and logical semantics, or can be a description model that uses that vocabulary to describe knowledge. OML has successfully been used at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the context of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), specifically to define the JPL systems engineering methodology in a highly modular and extensible way. Sirius has been used to define the authoring viewpoints that support such methodology. In this talk, we present how OML and Sirius can be used together, through the OML Rosetta Workbench, to streamline the development of an ontology-based modeling methodology and the authoring tools for it. The ideas will be demonstrated on a small example.
