The [openCAESAR](https://www.opencaesar.io/) team will be hosting **onto:Nexus 2024 : The 1st Workshop on Ontological Modeling and Analysis** at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/)) in Pasadena, CA on Wed Jan 31st, 2024. This is the day after [INCOSE IW](https://www.incose.org/IW2024), which will take place (Jan 27-30) in the close-by area of Torrance, CA.

This is a free hybrid event but will require advance registration for in-person attendance as the venue space is limited and the onboarding process (as JPL visitor) takes some time. If you are interested in attending, especially in person, please send your interest by IM or email to [Maged Elaasar](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) a.s.a.p., but definitely by the first week of December, and wait for a confirmation. Registration is also required for online attendance but the deadline will be closer to the event.

We will be working on the detailed agenda but the workshop will focus on the technology and its MBSE applications. It will cover what has been accomplished so far, what is currently in progress, and what will be the future directions and challenges. This will be done through invited presentations/demos from JPL and other players (from industry and research). This will also be an opportunity to hold discussions and form collaborations. As a bonus for in-person attendance, there will be a tour of JPL given.

Please feel free to [send us](mailto:elaasar@jpl.nasa.gov) your interest to attend and/ present, and any other suggestion you may have.
