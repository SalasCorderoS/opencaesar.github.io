# Abstract

This presentation given on June 2022 to the [Ontology PSIG](https://www.omg.org/ontology/) at the OMG was a shorter and more focused reprise of the original [openCAESAR workshop](http://www.opencaesar.io/caesar/2022/03/21/openCAESAR-Workshop-at-OMG.html) given on March 2020 to the larger OMG community. Beside introducing the openCAESAR project and its capabilities, it discusses the next steps for the PSIG in investigating openCAESAR.
