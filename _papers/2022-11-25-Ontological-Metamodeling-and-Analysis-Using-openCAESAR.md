## Abstract 
All modeling depends on having some vocabulary in which a model can be expressed. For the purpose of this chapter, we will define metamodeling as the modeling of vocabularies that can then be used to build useful models. This chapter will explain how standards developed for the semantic web can be used to produce precise vocabularies (ontologies) that can then be used as the foundation, on which to build precise descriptive models.
