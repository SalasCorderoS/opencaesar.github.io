## Abstract
In this paper we describe a system called the Computer Aided Engineering for Spacecraft System Architectures Tool Suite, or CAESAR for short, a platform for enabling model-based system engineering (MBSE). CAESAR recognizes that engineers are already likely to use models, but they typically keep the models private, only interpreting model information into documents or presentations that become project baseline. MBSE needs to enable more automated sharing of information directly between models to ensure model consistency, improve the rigor of engineering process, and ultimately, reduce the effort needed to get a clear answer to engineering questions. We explain the features of CAESAR, and describe how these features were leveraged in a case study where CAESAR was used to develop a model-based process for spacecraft electrical interface design and harness specification for the Europa Clipper flight project.
