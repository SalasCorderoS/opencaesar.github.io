## Summary

The JPL IMCE team is currently working on a major revision (v2) of OML that includes:

#### Enhancements

Simplification of the OML abstract syntax and its Java API without impacting the textual syntax:

1. Merged (and removed) class `AnnotatedElement` into class`IdentifiedElement` (the impact is that `Import` statements can no longer be annotated).
1. Collapsed the `Import` class  hierarchy into a single `Import` class with an enumeration kind that has literals: `extends`, `uses`, and `includes`.
1. Renamed class `Feature` to `Property`, made the latter the supertype of classes `AnnotatedProperty` and `SemanticProperty`, and made class `Relation` extend from `SemanticProperty`.
1. Collapsed the `Restriction` class hierarchy into 3 subclasses restricting range, cardinality, or value of a property, and made class `Entity` has a single collection for restrictions.
1. Made class `LinkAssertion` a subclass of `PropertyValueAssertion` and made class `NamedInstance` has a single collection of property value assertions.
1. Moved the types collection from both classes `ConceptInstance` and `RelationInstance` into their superclass `NamedInstance`.
1. Made class `RelationEntityPredicate` a subclass of both `UniaryPredicate` and `BinaryPredicate`.
1. Removed the `Reference` class hierarchy entirely and merged it into the `Member` class hierarchy (a member can have either a name or a ref to another member).

> Note that upon upgrading to v2, these changes may force migration of OML v1.x files with `.omlxmi` and `.omljson` extensions but not those with `.oml` extension. They may also force migration of code that uses the OML v1.x Java API.

#### New Features

New features to add to the experssivity of OML abstract syntax (and textual syntax):

1. Made `Annotation` have either a literal value or a reference (to a member) value. This would allow saying for ex.:
```
@rdfs:label "Aggregates"
@rdfs:seeAlso base:Contains
relation entity Aggregtes
```
1. Added a new class `UnreifiedRelation` as a subclass of `Relation` and (unlike classes `Forward` and `Reverse`) it can be declared independently of a `RelationEntity`. This would allow saying for ex.:   
```
relation performs [ // this is an unreified relation
  from Component 
  to Function 
  reverse isPerformedBy
  functional
]
```
1. Added a new class `BuiltIn` to represent a builtin function that can be called from a `Rule` as a predicate. Also, added a the standard vocabulary of SWRL builtins to the `core-vocabularies` set. This should allow saying for ex. 
```
rule FullName [
      firstName(?x, ?first) ^ 
      lastName(?x, ?last) ^ 
      swrlb:stringConcat(?full, ?first, " ", ?last) 
      -> fullName(?x, ?full)
]
```

#### Potential Features

Features under consideration that we appreciate your feedback on.

1. Add the Ability to define (`intersectionOf`, `unionOf`, `complementOf`) class expressions: 
```
concept A :> B [
  intersectionOf C, D [
        restricts some relation r to R1
  ]
]
```
1. Add the ability to define nested concept instances with link assertions:
```
ci c1 : mission:Component [
  mission:performs f1 : mission:Function
  mission:performs f2 : mission:Function [
        mission:invokes c1.f1 // or simply f1
  ]
]
```
