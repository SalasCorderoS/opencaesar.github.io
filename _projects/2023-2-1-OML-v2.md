## Summary

The JPL IMCE team is currently working on a major revision (v2) of OML that includes:

#### Enhancements

Revisions to the OML abstract syntax and its Java API (without impacting the textual syntax) to simplify them and move more syntactic checking to validation rules:

1. Merged (and removed) `AnnotatedElement` into `IdentifiedElement` (the impact is that `Import` can no longer be annotated).
1. Collapsed the import hierarchy into a single `Import` class with an enumeration kind that has literals: `extends`, `uses`, and `includes`.
1. Renamed `Feature` to `Property`, as the supertype of `AnnotatedProperty` and `SemanticProperty`, and made `Relation` extend `SemanticProperty`.
1. Collapsed the `Restriction` class hierarchy into 3 subclasses restricting range, cardinality, or value of a property and made `Entity` own a single collection for restrictions.
1. Made `LinkAssertion` a subclass of `PropertyValueAssertion` and made `NamedInstance` has a single collection of property value assertions.
1. Moved the types collection from classes `ConceptInstance` and `RelationInstance` into class `NamedInstance`.
1. Made `RelationEntityPredicate` a subclass of both `UniaryPredicate` and `BinaryPredicate`.
1. Removed the `Reference` class hierarchy and merged it into the corresponding `Member` class hierarchy (a member now can have either a name or a ref to another member).

> Note these changes may force migration of OML files with `.omlxmi` and `.omljson` extensions but not those with `.oml` extension. They may also force migration of code that uses the OML Java API.

#### New Features

New features to add to the experssivity of OML abstract syntax (and textual syntax):

1. Made `Annotation` have either a literal value or a reference (to a member) value. This would allow saying for ex.:
```
@rdfs:label "aggregates"
@rdfs:seeAlso base:contains
relation aggregtes
```
1. Added `UnreifiedRelation` as a new kind of `Relation` that (unlike `Forward`/`Reverse`) can be declared independently of a `RelationEntity`. This would allow saying for ex.:   
```
relation performs [
  from Component 
  to Function 
  reverse isPerformedBy
  functional
]
```
1. Added `BuiltIn` as a new class representing a builtin function that can be called as a predicate in a `Rule`, and added the standard library of SWRL builtins to `core-vocabularies`. This should allow saying for ex. 
```
rule FullName [
  firstName(?x, ?first) ^ 
  lastName(?x, ?last) ^ 
  swrlb:stringConcat(?full, ?first, " ", ?last) 
  -> fullName(?x, ?full)
]
```

#### Potential Features

Features under consideration that we appreciate your feedback on.

1. Add the Ability to define (`intersectionOf`, `unionOf`, `complementOf`) class expressions: 
```
concept A :> B [
  intersectionOf C, D [
        restricts some relation r to R1
  ]
]
```
1. Add the ability to define nested concept instances with link assertions:
```
ci c1 : mission:Component [
  mission:performs f1 : mission:Function
  mission:performs f2 : mission:Function [
        mission:invokes c1.f1 // or simply f1
  ]
]
```
