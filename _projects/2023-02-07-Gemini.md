## Summary

The project involves multidisciplinary fields including structural engineering, thermal analysis, system engineering, computer programming as well as the application of new developing technology including 3d metal printing fabrication, generative design with Autodesk Fusion360, and Ontological modeling language (OML) with OpenCaesar provided by JPL. One part of the team will setup and the create system application of Opencaesar including the ontology. The other part of the team performs the tasks of designing, analyzing, and fabricating of the optical tracker mount case study and utilize aforementioned Opencaesar application.
