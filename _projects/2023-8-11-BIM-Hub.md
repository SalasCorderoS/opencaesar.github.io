## Summary

BimHub is an R&D project that delivers an enterprise application for managing repositories of BIM models to faciliate automated analysis (with CI/CD pipelines) and peer review (with web-based views). The analysis will involve checking both the well-formedness of the BIM model as well as its conformance to a (multi-disciplinary) building code.

The technical approach involves managing BIM models in IFC format in Git, and on commit, translating them to ontologies, loading them to a semantic graph database, querying them with SPARQL, analyzing them with rules, and producing web-based views to show results.

The project will run a case study analyzing a given building design against a given building code.
