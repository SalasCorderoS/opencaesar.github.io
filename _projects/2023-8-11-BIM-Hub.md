## Summary

The BimHub project intends to develop an enterprise application for managing repositories of BIM models to faciliate their automated analysis (with CI/CD pipelines) and peer review (with web-based views) processes. The analysis will involve checking both the well-formedness of the BIM model as well as their conformance to a (multi-disciplinary) building code.

The technical approach involves managing BIM models in IFC format in Git, and on commit, translating them to ontologies, loading them to a semantic graph database, querying them with SPARQL, analyzing them with (discipline-specific) rules, and producing web-based views.

The project will involve a case study analyzing a given building model against a given building code.
