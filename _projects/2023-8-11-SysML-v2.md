## Summary

This project intends to develop an ontological representation of [SysML v2](https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/20230201/SysML.xmi) in [OML](http://www.opencaesar.io/oml/). First, an OML vocabulary equivalent to the MOF-based metamodel of SysML v2 will be generated using a MOF2OML adapter. Second, another OML vocabulary that extends the first will be be (manually) developed to add the missing DL semantics (by setting flags and specifying rules) that are expressed in the specification but not encoded in the metamodel. Third, an OML vocabulary bundle will be developed to close the world on the SysML v2 vocabularies. Fourth, some example SysML v2 models (based on ones from the SysML v2 working group) will be developed as OML descriptions that use the SysML v2 vocabularies. Fifth, some tools from the [openCAESAR](https://www.opencaesar.io/) project will be used to visualize, analyze, and report on those example models.
