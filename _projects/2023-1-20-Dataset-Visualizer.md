## Project Summary

Triple stores allow inspecting datasets via queries but the results are often shown in tabular format, i.e., not very visual. Our hope is to allow teams to inspect their datasets in a way thatâ€™s accessible to everyone; as an interactive network graph. A strong emphasis on shareability: being able to share a query result in a visual format with stakeholders with a simple link that can be opened in a browser. The app will consist of an interactive main screen for viewing/expanding the currently-explored graph, a search bar for querying the database (supporting either plain-text or SPARQL queries), a mechanism for loading data using the standard RDF format, and a mechanism for returning/exporting the screen contents.
