## Project Summary

The Fuseki server allows storing datasets in RDF format and querying them with SPARQL. Such a server only provides users with the ability to query the current snapshot of the datasets. One way to extend this is allowing users to query the datasetâ€™s history and see how the information has changed over time. 

Conveniently, Git stores versions of its files through commit-hashes, allowing users to roll-back to previous versions of files in the repository. Therefore, our goal is to provide an application whereby datasets managed in git repo are incrementally loaded to a Fuseki database annotated with repo's commit hashes. We would then allow users to specify a commit-hash or range of commit-hashes, when specifying dataset queries to inspect previous iterations of the dataset. The application will have a minimal command-line style interface where users can enter the Git repository URL and the target RDF dataset URL, then specify SPARQL queries.  With the query, a user can  provide a git commit-hash or commit-hash range to get the query results was or has changed over time.
