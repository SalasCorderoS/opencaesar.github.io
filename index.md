CAESAR stands for **C**omputer **A**ided **E**ngineering for **S**ystems **AR**chitecture. It is a software platform that supports the transformformation of Systems Engineering into a rigorous, integrated, and model-centric engineering practice. CAESAR supports the definition of a rigorous, multi-disciplinary, and tool-neutral methodology for Systems Engineering (SE). It adopts the semantic web approach for representing a system model as a set of ontologies. It also enables methodology-driven authoring of the system model using a set of federated system design tools, provides a semantic data wareouse for continuously integrating a set of model fragments into a unified system model, automates the analysis of the system model using a variety of analysis tools that inspect the model using ontology-based API and queries, faciliates the synchronization of the system model fragments by proposing changes based on insights gained from analyzing the system model, faciliates the review of the system model status by generating gate products and organizing them into easy to browse dashboards, and configuration manages the system model and protects its baseline using a change request process that allows peer-review, comments and approvals.
